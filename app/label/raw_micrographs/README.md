# Raw micrographs

Place your raw [MRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRC_(file_format))
micrographs in this directory. These can be pre-processed for web use by
running:

```python
python label/script/pre_process_micrographs.py
```

(This assumed that you are in the `app` directory.)

The script will be run automatically if using the Docker version of the
labelling app.
