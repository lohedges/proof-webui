# Micrographs

Place your raw MRC micrographs in this directory. These can be pre-processed
for web use by running:

```python
python label/script/pre_process_micrographs.py
```

(This assumed that you are in the `app` directory.)

The script will be run automatically if user the Docker version of the
labelling app.
